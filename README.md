# Controlling outdoor and indoor spread of COVID-19

This repository is prepared to understand the governmentâ€™s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) guidelines, supervised by Dr John Craske and Dr Adrian Callaghan. It aims to describe the effectiveness of government guidelines to reduce the spread of COVID-19 by airborne (aerosol) transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in outdoor and indoor spaces. The report and calculation script is broken down into two sections: (i) outdoor transmission of COVID-19 and (ii) indoor transmission of COVID-19.
